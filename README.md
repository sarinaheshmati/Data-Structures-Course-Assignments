# Data Structures Course Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains assignments from a Data Structures and Algorithms course, taught by Professor **Mohammad Akbari** and Professor **Sajad Shirali-Shahreza**. The projects demonstrate various concepts and techniques used in solving problems related to data structures and algorithms.

## Projects

1. **Interval Union**
   - Computes the union of a set of intervals on the number line and outputs it in a non-overlapping, standard format.

2. **Greedy Power Accumulation in Graphs**
   - Determines the minimum initial power required for a country to conquer all others in a graph-based representation, given specific constraints on power accumulation and neighboring relations.

[More Details](./Greedy Power Accumulation in Graphs/README.md)

3. **Gossip Relay Simulation**
   - Simulates the propagation of a secret among a group of friends based on directed "gossip" relationships, and calculates the minimum time required for the secret to be revealed to the originator again.

4. **Algebraic Expression Solver**
   - Parses and solves algebraic expressions, handling different types of operations and ensuring correct order of precedence.
